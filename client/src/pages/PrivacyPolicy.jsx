                        A privacy policy for an online learning management system outlines how user data is collected, used, and protected. It ensures transparency
                        about the types of personal information gathered, such as names, email addresses, payment details, and usage data. The policy typically explains
                        how this information is used to improve services, manage accounts, and personalize learning experiences. It emphasizes data security measures to
                        protect sensitive information and states that data will not be sold or shared without user consent, except with trusted partners or as required
                        by law. Users are also informed of their rights to access, update, or delete their data.
